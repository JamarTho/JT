## What I learned?

While I did not get to actually create the game I thought that I would list what I learned with SFML.
Installing SFML showed me how to navigate through paths, how to read through errors, and all in all navigate the terminal. Whether it be with Cygwin or Mysys, each of the offer a different and for me challenging approach to dealing with installation. As much as this is something I wanted to create for myself, I was unable to due to the many errors I did not know existed. Whether it be graphics drivers, dll, bin, and lib files, or even just setting up a compile command. Many things may go wrong but being able to work through and around to find solutions to me is what has been fun. While its not created the game itself, I feel learning some of the common issues and troubleshooting has allowed me to grow as a CS student has taught me a lot about not only softwares, but OOP as a whole.
